## Comparison: Orro Advertised vs Industry Standard

### Key Findings

#### ✅ **Strengths - Well Aligned with Industry**

1. **Clear Tiered Structure**
   - Orro has L1/L2/L3 tiering similar to industry standard
   - Escalation hierarchy is defined
   - Team Leader role for operations management

2. **Specialization Recognition**
   - SME role acknowledges need for deep expertise in specific areas
   - Example: Microsoft Advanced Services & Licences SME

3. **Training & Development**
   - Internship program for skill development
   - L3 and SME roles include training delivery to team
   - Focus on continuous learning mentioned

4. **Balanced Responsibilities**
   - Mix of technical support, project work, documentation
   - Communication and collaboration emphasized at all levels
   - Compliance and security awareness included

#### ⚠️ **Gaps - Areas for Clarification**

1. **Task Specificity - MAJOR GAP**
   - Orro job descriptions are **high-level and generic**
   - No detailed task lists (e.g., "Provide technical support for Cloud & Infrastructure")
   - Industry standard taxonomy has 300+ specific tasks
   - **Result**: "That isn't my job" conflicts likely due to ambiguity

2. **Escalation Criteria - MISSING**
   - No clear criteria for when L1 should escalate to L2
   - No criteria for when L2 should escalate to L3
   - Only generic "escalate issues unable to be resolved"
   - Industry standard has specific triggers (complexity, access, time, systemic)

3. **Technology Stack Detail - VAGUE**
   - Generic categories: "Cloud & Infrastructure, Modern Workplace technologies, Telephony, Networks"
   - No mention of specific technologies (Azure, M365, Intune, Teams, 3CX, etc.)
   - Industry standard lists exact tools per level (Exchange Online, SharePoint, Intune policies, etc.)

4. **FCR and Performance Targets - ABSENT**
   - No First Call Resolution targets mentioned
   - No escalation rate targets
   - No SLA compliance expectations
   - Industry standard has clear targets (L1 60-70% FCR, L2 75-85% FCR, etc.)

5. **Skill Progression - UNCLEAR**
   - What specific skills differentiate L1 from L2?
   - What certifications are required vs nice-to-have per level?
   - Industry standard has clear skill matrices and certification requirements

6. **Project Work Ambiguity**
   - All levels say "Assist with major projects as requested/directed"
   - What type of project work is appropriate for L1 vs L2 vs L3?
   - Industry standard clarifies: L2 owns small-medium projects, L3 owns strategic projects

7. **Infrastructure Team - MISSING**
   - No dedicated Infrastructure/Platform Engineering role in Orro advertised roles
   - Team structure analysis shows "Cloud - Infrastructure" team exists (6,603 tickets, 49.8%)
   - But no job description for proactive platform management role
   - Industry standard has dedicated Infrastructure team for automation and prevention

#### 🔴 **Critical Issues - Alignment Problems**

1. **"L3 Escalations" Misnomer**
   - Orro calls this "Service Desk Analyst (Escalations)"
   - But actual team data shows L3 is **NOT an escalation queue**
   - Only 82 tickets (0.6% of total) went to "Cloud - L3 Escalation"
   - **Reality**: L3 appears to be a specialized technical queue, not traditional escalation tier
   - **Conflict**: Job description says "manage and resolve complex incidents" but team name implies escalation endpoint

2. **L2 vs L3 Boundary Unclear**
   - Both do onsite work
   - Both do project work
   - Both provide "advanced support"
   - **Key difference**: L3 provides "direction and guidance to team members" + delivers training
   - But no clarity on technical complexity differences

3. **SME vs L3 Overlap**
   - SME has nearly identical responsibilities to L3
   - Only difference: SME has designated speciality area
   - Are SMEs senior to L3? Same level? Reporting unclear
   - Industry standard: SMEs are typically L3+ with deep specialization

4. **Team Leader Technical Expectations**
   - Team Leader "provides general remote support" and "attends onsite"
   - Is this a working team leader (50/50 management + hands-on)?
   - Or emergency escalation only?
   - Industry standard: Team Leaders focus on operations, coaching, performance (80-90% management)

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Week 1-2)

1. **Enhance Job Descriptions with Detailed Task Lists**
   - Add specific technology examples per role (Azure VMs, Intune policies, Exchange mail flow rules)
   - Use industry standard taxonomy as template
   - Define exactly what "Cloud & Infrastructure support" means per level

2. **Define Clear Escalation Criteria**
   - Document when L1 escalates to L2 (complexity, access, time >30-45min, systemic)
   - Document when L2 escalates to L3 (architectural changes, platform issues, advanced expertise)
   - Add escalation criteria to job descriptions

3. **Clarify L3 Role Naming**
   - Either rename to "Service Desk Analyst (Senior/Specialist)" to avoid "Escalations" confusion
   - Or clearly define that L3 is escalation **endpoint** (final tier before vendor)

### Short-Term (Month 1-2)

4. **Add Performance Targets**
   - L1 FCR: 60-70%, Escalation Rate: 30-40%
   - L2 FCR: 75-85%, Escalation Rate: 15-25%
   - L3 Resolution: 90-95%, Vendor Escalation: <5%

5. **Create Skill Matrices**
   - Define minimum skills per level (technical + soft skills)
   - Required certifications vs nice-to-have per level
   - Example: L1 requires MS-900, L2 requires MS-102, L3 requires AZ-305

6. **Define Project Work Boundaries**
   - L1: No project work (focus on tickets)
   - L2: Small-medium projects (<100 users, <2 weeks)
   - L3: Large strategic projects (>100 users, multi-week, architectural)

### Medium-Term (Month 3-6)

7. **Create Infrastructure/Platform Engineering Role**
   - Define dedicated role for proactive platform management
   - Automation development, alert tuning, capacity planning
   - Shift "Cloud - Infrastructure" team from reactive to proactive

8. **Standardize Role Nomenclature**
   - Consider: Service Desk Analyst I, II, III, Senior, Lead
   - Or: Service Desk Engineer L1, L2, L3, Principal, Manager
   - Match industry standard terminology for external hiring

9. **Review Team Leader Expectations**
   - Clarify management vs hands-on work ratio
   - Define when Team Leader performs hands-on support (escalations only? coverage gaps?)
   - Ensure Team Leader has time for coaching, performance reviews, operations management

## Alignment Score: Orro vs Industry Standard

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Role Structure** | 8/10 | ✅ Good tiered structure, ⚠️ L3 naming confusion |
| **Task Specificity** | 3/10 | 🔴 Major gap - very generic, no detailed task lists |
| **Escalation Criteria** | 2/10 | 🔴 Missing clear criteria for escalation triggers |
| **Technology Detail** | 3/10 | 🔴 Vague categories, no specific tool mentions |
| **Performance Targets** | 0/10 | 🔴 No FCR, escalation rate, or SLA targets |
| **Skill Progression** | 4/10 | ⚠️ Some progression implied but not explicit |
| **Project Work Clarity** | 3/10 | 🔴 All levels "assist" but boundaries unclear |
| **Training & Development** | 7/10 | ✅ Good focus on training, internship program |
| **Communication Focus** | 9/10 | ✅ Excellent emphasis on communication |
| **Infrastructure Role** | 0/10 | 🔴 Missing dedicated proactive platform role |

**Overall Alignment Score**: **39/100 (39%)** - Significant gaps requiring attention

**Primary Issue**: Orro job descriptions are **strategic/high-level** but lack **tactical detail** needed to prevent "that isn't my job" conflicts. Industry standard taxonomy provides the detailed task lists and escalation criteria Orro needs.

---

**Recommendation**: Use this analysis + industry standard taxonomy to create enhanced Orro role documentation with specific task lists and clear boundaries.

**Next Step**: Build side-by-side comparison table showing Orro advertised roles alongside industry standard detailed task categories for management review.
