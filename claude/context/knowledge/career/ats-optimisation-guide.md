# ATS Optimisation Guide

**REMINDER: Follow core non-negotiable standards in CLAUDE.md**
- Australian English spelling (optimise not optimize, centre not center, analyse not analyze)
- Sentence case formatting for all headings and bullet points
- Never merge experiences - each bullet must be from a single exp_id
- Use exact database metrics only - never create or calculate new figures

---

## Dynamic CV Bullet Creation Framework

### **Language and Formatting Standards**
- **ALWAYS use Australian English spelling** (e.g., optimise not optimize, centre not center, analyse not analyze)
- **ALWAYS use sentence case** for headings and bullet points (capitalise first word and proper nouns only)
- **These standards are NON-NEGOTIABLE** and must never be removed or overridden

### **Dynamic Bullet Creation Process:**
1. **Extract Raw Data**: Use `full_context` + `metrics` from selected experiences
2. **Apply JD Keywords Strategically**: 
   - **Match exactly**: Industry-standard terms (stakeholder management, cloud transformation, P&L responsibility)
   - **Adapt/generalise**: Company-specific terms ("tech hub" → "innovation centre", proprietary names → functional descriptions)
   - **Translate uniqueness**: Convert company jargon to widely-understood equivalents
3. **Use Power Verb Framework**: [POWER VERB] + [SCOPE/CONTEXT] + [METHOD] + [QUANTIFIED RESULT]
4. **Tailor to Role**: Emphasise aspects most relevant to target position

### **Power Verb Framework Application:**
- **POWER VERB**: Strong action verb showing leadership (Led, Developed, Collaborated, Orchestrated)
- **SCOPE/CONTEXT**: JD-relevant context using appropriate terminology (adapt company-specific terms to industry-standard language)
- **METHOD**: How the work was accomplished (frameworks, engagement approaches, processes)
- **QUANTIFIED RESULT**: Specific metrics from database demonstrating business impact

### **Key Advantages:**
- **Smart JD Optimisation**: Matches industry-standard keywords while adapting company-specific terms for authenticity
- **Role Flexibility**: Same experience positioned differently for BRM vs TAM vs CSM roles
- **Impact Focus**: Stronger alignment with specific role expectations
- **Strategic Positioning**: Elevates from technical tasks to business value delivery

### **Quality Validation** (from Power Verb Framework):
- ✅ Strong action verb showing leadership
- ✅ Specific context showing scope and stakeholder level
- ✅ Clear method/approach taken  
- ✅ Quantified result with business impact
- ✅ Strategic rather than operational focus
- ✅ Cross-functional collaboration emphasis
- ✅ Business value beyond task completion

**Always reference `/methodology/cv-bullet-point-framework.md` for detailed power verb selection and structure guidance.**

## ATS Scoring Strategy

### Keyword Matching Priorities
1. **Exact phrase matches** from JD (highest weight)
2. **Industry-standard terminology** (high weight)
3. **Contextual keyword density** (medium weight)
4. **Semantic equivalents** (lower weight)

### Safe vs Risky Optimisation

#### ✅ **Safe Optimisations**
- Natural synonym swapping ("strategic" → "collaborative")
- Contextual keyword placement around real experiences
- Exact punctuation matching from JD
- Industry-standard terminology alignment

#### ⚠️ **Risky Optimisations** 
- Company-specific terms you haven't used ("Tech Hub" if never worked with one)
- Processes you haven't done ("annual work priorities" without experience)
- Inflated role descriptions ("led comprehensive strategy" vs "participated in strategy")

### Authentication Strategy
- **Every keyword must be backed by real experience** you can confidently discuss
- **Prepare interview stories** for each major claim
- **Use contextual placement** rather than forced terminology
- **Maintain genuine expertise** over keyword gaming

## Common ATS Optimisation Patterns

### Business Relationship Management Roles
- **Key phrases**: "stakeholder management", "business priorities", "demand management"
- **Team leadership**: Specific team sizes and engagement levels
- **Strategic work**: "business unit goals", "digital transformation", "cost optimisation"
- **Liaison role**: "primary contact", "bridge between", "collaborative relationships"

### Technical Advisory Roles
- **Advisory capacity**: "technical advisory board", "strategic guidance", "architectural decisions"
- **Strategy work**: "technology roadmaps", "digital strategy", "transformation programs"
- **Business alignment**: "business-technology alignment", "service delivery outcomes"

### Project Management Roles
- **Scale indicators**: Dollar amounts, team sizes, timeline compression
- **Process improvement**: "workflow optimisation", "resource allocation", "operational efficiency"
- **Crisis management**: "escalation point", "stakeholder communication", "business continuity"

## Interview Preparation Integration

### Authentic Storytelling
- **STAR method preparation** for each major bullet point
- **Quantified examples** ready for "tell me about a time" questions
- **Stakeholder context** prepared for relationship management questions
- **Challenge/solution narratives** for problem-solving questions

### Avoiding ATS Traps
- **Don't claim unfamiliar processes** just for keywords
- **Prepare authentic alternatives** for company-specific terminology
- **Practice explaining** your actual role vs inflated descriptions
- **Have backup examples** if primary stories are challenged
