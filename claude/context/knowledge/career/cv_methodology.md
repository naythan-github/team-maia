# CV Creation Methodology

**MANDATORY: Follow ALL core non-negotiable standards in CLAUDE.md**

## Overview

Systematic CV creation using a 4-stage process to ensure complete accuracy and optimal relevance. This methodology supports both Full and Brief CV formats using identical database-driven selection with different presentation styles.

## Format Types

### Full CV Format
- **Target**: Senior roles requiring comprehensive storytelling
- **Structure**: ~23-36 bullets with 2-line detailed impact statements
- **Use Case**: Complex roles, detailed applications, senior positions

### Brief CV Format  
- **Target**: Quick applications, networking scenarios
- **Structure**: ~23-36 bullets with 10-20 word ultra-concise impact statements
- **Use Case**: Rapid applications, initial screenings, space-constrained formats

### Unified Bullet Allocation (Both Formats)

**Professional Experience Allocation:**
- **Zetta**: 3-5 bullets
- **Telstra Purple**: 4-7 bullets
- **OneAdvanced**: 3-5 bullets per role (6-10 total for 2 roles)
- **Viadex**: 2-3 bullets
- **Halsion**: 2-3 bullets
- **Total Professional Experience**: ~17-28 bullets

**Key Achievements Allocation:**
- 6-8 bullets (4-5 highest JD relevance + 2-3 career moments)

**Overall Total**: ~23-36 bullets

**Note**: Both formats use identical bullet allocation. The difference is presentation:
- **Full CV**: 2-line comprehensive storytelling per bullet
- **Brief CV**: 10-20 word ultra-concise impact statements per bullet

## Core Principles

### Database Integrity
- Each bullet traces to single exp_id with exact metrics
- No experience merging or metric combination
- No repetition between Key Achievements and Professional Experience sections
- Exact database metrics only - never create or calculate new figures

### Selection Strategy
- **Semantic Matching**: AI-powered relevance scoring against job requirements
- **Dynamic Selection**: Best experiences surface regardless of employer
- **Hybrid Allocation**: 4-5 JD-relevant + 2-3 career moments for Key Achievements
- **Cross-Database Optimization**: Pure relevance over employer constraints

### Quality Standards
- **Australian English**: Optimise, centre, analyse (not US variants)
- **Sentence Case**: All headings and content formatting
- **Professional Formatting**: Bold openings, proper spacing, clean structure
- **ATS Optimization**: Keyword density and structure verification
