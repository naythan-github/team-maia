# Active Maia Projects

## Overview
This document tracks active development projects ready for implementation when requested.

## Project Queue

### 🚀 **Context Compression Pilot Project** ⭐ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
*Status: Planning Complete - Awaiting Implementation Request*
*Expected Duration: 15-20 days total (3 phases)*
*Expected Outcome: 70-80% total token savings with quality preservation*

**Goal**: Implement semantic context compression pilot to achieve significant efficiency gains while preserving all capabilities through comprehensive validation.

**Quick Summary**: 
- Phase 1: Risk assessment and validation testing (3-5 days)
- Phase 2: Limited pilot on safe content (5-7 days) 
- Phase 3: Production readiness validation (7-10 days)

**Key Features**:
- Conservative approach focusing on safest compression targets
- Integration with existing smart loading (12-62% savings)
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms and quality preservation
- 100% reconstruction accuracy requirement
- Fail-safe design defaulting to full content when uncertain

**Risk Level**: Low-Medium (extensive validation and fallbacks)
**Complexity**: Medium (well-defined implementation plan)
**Value**: High (potential 30-40% additional efficiency gains)

**Documentation**: Complete implementation plan in `/claude/context/core/development_decisions.md`

### 📋 **Tool Naming & Archival Strategy** 
*Status: Planning Phase - Architecture Defined*
*Expected Duration: 2-3 weeks*
*Expected Outcome: 95%+ tool discovery accuracy*

**Goal**: Implement hybrid architecture with enhanced registry to solve 406-tool naming conflicts and discovery failures.

**Quick Summary**:
- Registry infrastructure with domain organization
- Discovery framework integration
- Usage analytics and archival identification
- Naming optimization based on failure analysis

**Documentation**: Implementation plan in `/claude/context/core/development_decisions.md`

### 🧪 **TDD Protocol Integration**
*Status: Documentation Complete - Integration Pending*
*Expected Duration: 1-2 days*
*Expected Outcome: Systematic TDD workflow for all development*

**Goal**: Complete integration of TDD development protocol into mandatory context loading and system workflows.

**Remaining Tasks**:
- Add TDD protocol to mandatory context loading sequence
- Create git commit for TDD protocol documentation

## Project Selection Criteria

### **High Priority** (Ready for immediate implementation)
- Context Compression Pilot: Maximum efficiency gains with quality preservation
- TDD Protocol Integration: System workflow improvement

### **Medium Priority** (Planning complete, awaiting capacity)
- Tool Naming & Archival: Long-term system organization improvement

### **How to Start a Project**
When ready to begin a project, simply ask: "What's next?" or "Let's start the [project name]"

All projects have complete implementation plans and are ready for execution.
