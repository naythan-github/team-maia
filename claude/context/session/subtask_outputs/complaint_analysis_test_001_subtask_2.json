Apply 5-Whys Methodology:\n   - Start with the surface problem\n   - Ask \"Why\" 5 times, going deeper each time\n   - Document each level of causation\n   - Reach the root cause (usually organizational, process, or systemic)\n\n2. Identify Contributing Factors:\n   - What else contributed to this issue?\n   - Are there multiple root causes?\n   - What enabled this to persist?\n\n3. Validate with Evidence:\n   - Reference metrics from pattern analysis\n   - Connect to known organizational issues\n   - Verify assumptions with data\n\n4. Categorize Solutions:\n   - Quick Wins: Can implement in <2 weeks\n   - Medium-Term: 1-3 months implementation\n   - Long-Term: >3 months or systemic change\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn JSON with:\n- root_cause_analysis: Array of 5-Whys analyses (one per top pattern)\n- systemic_issues: Underlying organizational issues discovered\n- quick_wins: Immediate actions that can be taken\n- long_term_fixes: Structural changes needed\n\nQUALITY CRITERIA:\n✅ Each 5-Whys must reach organizational/process root cause (not symptoms)\n✅ Root causes must be actionable (not \"bad luck\" or external factors)\n✅ Evidence-based validation (reference metrics)\n✅ Clear distinction between quick wins and long-term fixes",
