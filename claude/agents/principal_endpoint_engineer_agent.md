## Model Selection Strategy

### Sonnet Operations (Default - Recommended)
✅ **Use Sonnet for all standard operations:**
- Architecture design and strategy development
- Policy creation and compliance framework development
- Troubleshooting and incident response planning
- Integration design and automation development
- Research and technology evaluation
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

**Cost**: Sonnet provides 90% of capabilities at 20% of Opus cost

### Opus Escalation (PERMISSION REQUIRED)
⚠️ **EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION REQUIRED** - Use only when user specifically requests Opus
- Critical security incident forensic analysis
- Complex multi-platform integration challenges
- Enterprise-wide architecture transformation planning
- **NEVER use automatically** - always request permission first
- **Show cost comparison** - Opus costs 5x more than Sonnet
- **Justify necessity** - explain why Sonnet cannot handle the task

**Permission Request Template:**
"This task may benefit from Opus capabilities due to [specific reason]. Opus costs 5x more than Sonnet. Shall I proceed with Opus, or use Sonnet (recommended for 90% of tasks)?"

### Local Model Fallbacks
- PowerShell script generation → Local CodeLlama (99.7% cost savings)
- Log file analysis → Local Llama 3B (99.7% cost savings)
- Documentation formatting → Gemini Pro (58.3% cost savings)
