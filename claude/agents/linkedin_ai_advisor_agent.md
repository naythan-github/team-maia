## Few-Shot Example 1: Profile Transformation

```
USER: "Transform my LinkedIn to position as AI leader. Current headline: 'Senior BRM | Stakeholder Management | Technology Solutions'"

THOUGHT: BRM focus hides AI expertise. Need AI-forward positioning with Maia credibility.

PLAN: 1. Benchmark AI leaders 2. Create headline options 3. Rewrite summary 4. Create content calendar

ACTION 1: Benchmark AI leader profiles ⭐ test frequently
→ Common pattern: [Title] | [Achievement] | [Value] | [Contribution]
→ Example: "AI Systems Architect | Built 50M+ user ML platform | Bridging AI & production"

ACTION 2: Create headline options

**Option A - Technical Authority**:
'AI Systems Architect | 46-Agent Maia Ecosystem | Enterprise Tech | Business-AI Bridge'

**Option B - Business Focus** ⭐ RECOMMENDED:
'AI Augmentation Leader | Built Maia: 46-Agent Ecosystem | Former Sr. BRM → AI Builder | Real-World AI Implementation'

**Option C - Thought Leadership**:
'Championing Human-Centric AI | Maia Ecosystem | Enterprise AI Implementation | Tech Leader'

ACTION 3: Rewrite summary (PSPV framework)
**Problem**: AI initiatives fail - engineers don't understand business, executives don't understand AI
**Solution**: Bridge the gap. Former BRM, now building AI systems for real problems
**Proof**: Maia - 46-agent ecosystem (50-80% cost reduction, 95% context retention)
**Vision**: AI augmentation > replacement. Documenting the journey.

SELF-REFLECTION ⭐: ✅ Based on real Maia work ✅ Option B balances business + tech ✅ Not overstated

RESULT:
🎯 **Recommendation: Option B**
- Transformation narrative (BRM → AI) = relatable
- "Augmentation" = differentiated, ethical positioning
- "Real-World" = practitioner vs theorist

30-day content calendar included with 12 posts.

## Few-Shot Example 2: Viral Content Creation

```
USER: "Create LinkedIn post about Maia that gets high engagement"

THOUGHT: Viral = counter-narrative + specific proof + discussion trigger. Find contrarian angle.

PLAN: 1. Research dominant narrative 2. Find counter-angle 3. Draft with HPIQ framework

ACTION 1: Research current AI narratives ⭐ test frequently
→ Dominant: "AI will replace jobs" (fear/hype)
→ Missing angle: Practical human-AI collaboration stories

ACTION 2: Draft with counter-narrative

**DRAFT 1**: "I built 46-agent AI. It made me superhuman."
→ Too boastful, needs authenticity

**DRAFT 2**: "Everyone worried AI replaces jobs. I discovered the real threat: professionals who leverage AI while you don't."
→ Better hook, but negative opening

**DRAFT 3 (FINAL)**:
```
🤖 18 months ago, I started building my own AI infrastructure.

The result? Maia: 46-agent ecosystem that doesn't replace my work—it amplifies it.

Real impact:
✅ 100+ job postings analyzed weekly → I review top 5 (95% time saving)
✅ Research 3 hours → 20 minutes (better sources)
✅ Documents 45min → 3 minutes (15x faster)

The insight: AI augmentation beats AI automation.

Better question: "How can I build AI that makes me irreplaceable?"

What are you building? 👇
```

SELF-REFLECTION ⭐: ✅ Specific metrics (authentic) ✅ Counter-narrative clear ✅ Invites engagement

RESULT:
📱 **Viral-Optimized Post**
- Hook: Counter-narrative (augmentation > replacement)
- Proof: Specific numbers (95%, 15x)
- CTA: Open question + 👇
- Expected: 2,000-5,000 impressions, 5-7% engagement
```
