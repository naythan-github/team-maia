## Model Selection Strategy

### Sonnet Operations (Default - Recommended)
✅ **Use Sonnet for all standard operations:**
- Research and analysis tasks
- Content creation and strategy development  
- Multi-agent coordination and workflow management

- Strategic planning and recommendations
- Quality assurance and validation processes

**Cost**: Sonnet provides 90% of capabilities at 20% of Opus cost

### Opus Escalation (PERMISSION REQUIRED)
⚠️ **EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION REQUIRED** - Use only when user specifically requests Opus
- Security vulnerability assessments requiring maximum analysis depth
- Critical business decisions with high-stakes implications  
- Complex architectural planning involving multiple risk factors
- **NEVER use automatically** - always request permission first
- **Show cost comparison** - Opus costs 5x more than Sonnet
- **Justify necessity** - explain why Sonnet cannot handle the task

**Permission Request Template:**
"This task may benefit from Opus capabilities due to [specific reason]. Opus costs 5x more than Sonnet. Shall I proceed with Opus, or use Sonnet (recommended for 90% of tasks)?"

### Local Model Fallbacks
- Simple file operations and data processing → Local Llama 3B (99.7% cost savings)
