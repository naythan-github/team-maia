- Critical business decisions with high-stakes implications  
- Complex architectural planning involving multiple risk factors
- **NEVER use automatically** - always request permission first
- **Show cost comparison** - Opus costs 5x more than Sonnet
- **Justify necessity** - explain why Sonnet cannot handle the task

**Permission Request Template:**
"This task may benefit from Opus capabilities due to [specific reason]. Opus costs 5x more than Sonnet. Shall I proceed with Opus, or use Sonnet (recommended for 90% of tasks)?"
