**Period**: 2025-10-09 to 2025-10-16 (7 days)
**Generated**: 2025-10-16 10:23:11

## Executive Summary

❌ **Overall Acceptance Rate**: 0.0% (Target: >80%)
- **Total Suggestions**: 1
- **Accepted**: 0 (0.0%)
- **Rejected**: 1 (100.0%)
- **Avg Confidence**: 85.0%
- **Avg Query Complexity**: 7.0/10

### Key Findings

❌ **Critical** - Routing accuracy significantly below target
⚠️  **Low Sample Size** - Need more data for statistical significance

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. 🔴 Overall

**Priority**: CRITICAL

**Issue**: Overall acceptance rate is 0.0% (target: >80%)

**Recommendation**: Review and refine intent classification and agent selection logic

**Expected Impact**: +10-15% acceptance rate improvement

**Implementation**: Analyze override patterns, adjust thresholds, refine agent matching

### 2. 🟠 Confidence Calibration

**Priority**: HIGH

**Issue**: High confidence (85.0%) but low acceptance (0.0%)

**Recommendation**: Recalibrate confidence scoring - coordinator is overconfident

**Expected Impact**: +5-10% accuracy through better confidence calibration

**Implementation**: Review confidence calculation, lower thresholds for routing suggestions


## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize recommendations above
2. Implement critical/high priority improvements
3. Monitor acceptance rate for improvement
4. Re-run analysis after 7 days
