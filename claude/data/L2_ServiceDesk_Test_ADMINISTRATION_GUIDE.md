```

### Step 2: During Test (120 minutes)

**Proctor Responsibilities**:
- Start timer when candidate begins
- Monitor candidate (prevent cheating)
- Minimize distractions
- Answer clarification questions (about test format only, not technical content)

**Time Warnings**:

**Handling Issues**:
- **Technical problems** (internet down, system crash): Pause timer, resolve issue, resume
- **Clarification requests**: Answer only test format questions, not technical content
  - ✅ OK: "Do I select one answer or multiple?" → "Select ONE best answer"

- **Early finish**: Allow candidate to leave early, collect materials, remind of confidentiality

**Red Flags to Watch**:
- Looking at phone repeatedly (potential cheating)
- Typing into chat/messaging apps

## Scoring Procedures

### Step 1: Score the Test (30-45 minutes)

**Use Answer Key**:
1. Open `L2_ServiceDesk_Technical_Test_ANSWER_KEY_CONFIDENTIAL.md`
2. Compare candidate answers to correct answers
3. Mark each question as Correct (1 point) or Incorrect (0 points)
4. **Special Note**: Question 49 accepts EITHER A or B as correct

**Scoring Template** (Excel/Google Sheets):

| Q# | Candidate Answer | Correct Answer | Points | Category |
|----|------------------|----------------|--------|----------|
| 1  | B                | B              | 1      | Telephony |
| 2  | B                | B              | 1      | Telephony |
| ... | ...             | ...            | ...    | ...      |

**Calculate Scores**:
- **Overall Score**: Total points / 50 × 100 = ___%
- **Category Scores**: Calculate per category (10 questions each):
  - Telephony (Q1-10): ___ / 10 = ___%
  - Account Mgmt (Q11-20): ___ / 10 = ___%
  - M365 & Cloud (Q21-30): ___ / 10 = ___%
  - Security (Q31-40): ___ / 10 = ___%
  - Infrastructure (Q41-50): ___ / 10 = ___%

---

### Step 2: Interpret Results

**Pass/Fail Determination**:
1. Check overall score ≥70% (35/50)
2. Check EACH category ≥50% (5/10)
3. Both conditions must be met to PASS

**Result Categories**:

| Score Range | Category | Hiring Recommendation |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| 90-100% (45-50) | **EXCELLENT** | Strong Hire - Senior L2 or Lead candidate |
| 80-89% (40-44) | **STRONG** | Hire - Solid L2 candidate |
| 70-79% (35-39) | **PASS** | Consider - Junior-Mid L2, training needed |
| 60-69% (30-34) | **BORDERLINE FAIL** | Likely Pass - Review weak categories |
| <60% (<30) | **FAIL** | Do Not Progress - Insufficient foundation |

**Category Analysis**:
- **Strong in all 5 categories** (all ≥70%): Well-rounded candidate
- **Strong in 3-4, weak in 1-2** (some <60%): Trainable if weak areas not critical
- **Weak in 3+ categories** (multiple <50%): Significant knowledge gaps

---

### Step 3: Review Incorrect Answers

**Identify Patterns** (see Answer Key for guidance):

**Red Flag Patterns**:
- Frequently chooses "restart/reinstall" = Reactive, not systematic
- Chooses "ignore" on security questions = Security awareness concern
- Immediately escalates to vendor/support = Lacks troubleshooting confidence
- Multiple errors in one category = Knowledge gap in that domain

**Neutral Patterns**:
- Misses complex questions (Q18, Q22, Q26, Q34, Q45, Q47) = Normal - these are difficult
- Inconsistent within category = Natural variation, not systematic gap

**Sample Interview Questions**:
- "You scored [X]% on the test - excellent. Tell me about the most complex technical issue you've resolved."
- "Question [X where they were correct] - walk me through your complete troubleshooting approach."
- "How would you mentor a junior team member struggling with [any weak area]?"

**For Borderline Candidates (70-79%)**:
1. Validate weak category knowledge hands-on
2. Assess learning ability and training receptiveness
3. Cultural fit and motivation
4. Salary expectations (mid-range)

**Sample Interview Questions**:
- "Your [weak category] score was [X]%. Tell me about your hands-on experience with [technology]."
- "Let's walk through a scenario: [Give scenario from weak category]. What would you do first?"
- "How do you typically learn new technologies? Give me an example."

## Test Security & Confidentiality

### Protecting Test Integrity

**DO**:
- Keep answer key confidential (secure file storage)
- Limit test distribution (only candidates being assessed)
- Version control (if questions need updating, version the test)
- Track who has taken the test (prevent retakes without variation)
- Remind candidates of confidentiality

**DON'T**:
- Post test questions publicly
- Share answer key with non-hiring team members
- Allow candidates to keep test booklet
- Reuse exact same test if questions have been compromised

### Test Lifespan

**Review Quarterly**:
- Are question difficulty distributions correct? (track pass rates per question)
- Do any questions have universal failure? (may need rewording)
- Has technology changed? (update questions if platforms evolve)

**Update Annually**:
- Refresh 10-15 questions based on new incident patterns
- Remove outdated technology questions
- Add questions for new platforms/services

## Appendix B: Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Test Administration Issues

**Issue**: Candidate finishes in <60 minutes
**Action**: Note on score sheet. If score <70%, likely guessing. If score ≥80%, legitimately skilled.

**Issue**: Candidate requests clarification on technical terminology
**Action**: "Use available resources (internet, documentation) to answer the question."

**Issue**: Internet outage during test
**Action**: Pause timer, troubleshoot connectivity, resume. Extend time by outage duration.

**Issue**: Candidate disputes answer after reviewing results
**Action**: Politely explain test is based on industry best practices and real-world scenarios. Do not provide answer key.

**Issue**: Low pass rate (<50% of candidates passing)
**Action**: Review question difficulty. May need to adjust passing score or revise questions.
