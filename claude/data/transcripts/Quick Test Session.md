All day, every day, every single time, the stage looks 10 or 15 or 20 seconds. Similarly, smart ticket triage now, available in all tasks, saves the time on every single ticket by helping them automatically classify tickets. We look at the entire history of your ticket system and help me analyze what should be the correct submission type, the priority, what cue these tickets are going to, so your technicians don't have to spend so much time doing this.

Over today, make your team not much more efficient. Another exciting AI capability that's coming very soon at IT Loop is Smart Assist from Housewives. Smart Assist helps you analyze your password security so you can identify duplicated passwords, leave passwords, or passwords that are to stale at need to be rotated. But the most exciting AI capability that we're bringing to SAP S

## [16:18:57]
Natural Language interface to the SAP Pacificia platform to help you analyze and better utilize your data. Let's have a look at kombra coach action. So here, we have a technician who's working in IT Loop and they've got a bunch of empty items in their menu. They want to clean this up. So they ask kombra coach, "Hey, how are you ready to leave blank items in my menu or the left head side?" The kombra coach is in natural language and is slightly different than the exact link

## [16:19:32]
I'm trying to find the appropriate article to do this, send kombra coach into teleknight to this and if they have a follow-up question, they can interact with them, be knowledgeable, and help them through this follow-up. This is a very simple example of how to get better value out of the topboard by interacting with kombra coach. But kombra coach is not just limited to explaining how to do things in the topboard. It's also going to help inspect and analyze data so our technician can ask it, "Do you

know the version 10 or older?" And you'll be able to do that. They want to filter it down with specific organization, you'll be able to do that. If you look at their entire data set and provide them with interesting analysis and reports, you'll also be able to take actions for our technician. So our technician needs to write an SOP for a 2D VPN set up on a Macboard station. He'll be able to do that for him. And what's really neat about this game is look at the organization that it's writing back in pns.for.

## [16:20:39]
The organization understands the current IP address, the current passphrase, the stock management pass manager, and the other right and various specific SOP format exact client. This is much more powerful than the people that you never know about, like if you ask try to get to this. That's how that contextual information applies to the data's business system. Now improving your margins is not the only benefit of your standard SOP. It also makes it easier for you to manage all the vendors that you have to

## [16:21:12]
make your interactions with the SAVA. Now you can book your self-service, your professional services engagements, use your self-service, and you can say, "I want." Not only do you both your Maven bus, but you can see the entire calendar of all engagements you have booked so you're full team and understand whether or not the next onboarding or professional services that you have with us. You can manage your auto-rendials inside the SAVA line form. SAVA line can change your original size. And you can

## [16:21:46]
get the original PDF or from us without having to ask your manager to look at our consent to you. SAVA allows you to act your fingertips. Another benefit of standardizing on the platform is having all of your data in one place or else is to use it to better serve you to help your business. For example, that is helping you grow the revenue by arguing your TBR process, making it much easier

## [16:22:19]
to look at the Maven bus process involving TBR as an action. So here we start in new SAVA 1 because that's the entry point of the platform. Once I'm logged in, you can say, "I want to access the entire platform without having to be authenticated." I choose Maven bus process and I'm taken into my home page in Maven bus process which happens to be this for GTB. That's custom-m

## [16:22:53]
We can customize it or it's content out of your digital widgets or out of your digital data points. All of the data comes in from the rest of the platform fed into the system so you can report on your ticket volume, your backup status, your security, your invitation for that customer and generate a beautiful TBR for your customers in just a few places. Instead of the hours it takes you to call this together for many different sources. So that is a quick look for

## [16:23:26]
So I remember when I talked earlier, you want to get to thousands of endpoints per technician. These are just the beginning steps to get us there. There are some massive changes for the next 12-18 months to help you with that. Thank you so much. [Applause] Thank you so much. Now let's look at the S-Mart portfolio as well as the off-portfolio. More great
