I'm going to start back in about six times a day. This is quite important. Now, when you're doing work, if you lose a user or guess on problem with a group or some other object in LtraID, restorations are very simple. You can select from a list of users you can select from the list of groups. It's very easy for you to work your way through the product and find any particular piece of data you need to restore, or the entire tenant, if that's the case. If you've ever actually lost an entire Microsoft by LtraID 10 or an active record,

## [16:36:34]
you know that that process can take the weeks. It's very difficult to do this for a little bit of Microsoft about it. With LtraID backup, we can restore from one tenant to another. So if you lose a tenant, you can create a new tenant and take the data from your current one, put it in the middle, and your backup running in seconds. It's a very important capability. There's some good offers here. If you sign H12 month or 100 license in contract or LtraID backup, we'll give you the first three months for free. If you are a current to SaaS protection or spanning customer,

you'll get a penny greater to your business than bringing to your customers. As Jim mentioned earlier today, if you're a Kisea 365 user subscriber, this is included in your subscription and no additional cost. That was area six. Next generation partner, we are very, very excited about what this is going to do. The number one piece of feedback that we've gotten from you since Kisea acquired.hote is to bring back the desktop. It's not all customers have racks of data.

## [16:37:41]
The more segment of your customers might be a little bit smaller. You'll have data closets and other things. In fact, across this product portfolio, there are 28 different units that you can deploy depending on the configuration of the site or whatever scenario you need to offer. There's great capability in this new series of sites of product. First, on the desktop side, we're actually using DCDR optimized C-commutes to help them vary effects. A lot of our competitors use laptops to use them, G-commutes and other servers slow. This is one of the most important things that we've seen in the past.

## [16:38:15]
We've been asked in the NVN right times. So the ability to get enterprise class performance in the desktop is a great and very probable thing. In the graph, the capability is just to get our series five series to maximum storage capacity. You could have any way to 60 terabytes or a happy share that can be mainly expanded on to 120 terabytes. You also have a great range of CPU options, always Intel processors that evaluate range. You want to bring lower prices to your customers all the way up to the high performance.

## [16:38:49]
We have credit RAM, the EO4 to EDR5 is a memory that is 50% faster than this new generation hardware. Maybe most importantly, for those of you who are doing migrations, you can bring these forward from a series five, appliances. We have a series five to series six mapping tool to make migrations simple and governless. This pairs very nicely with the commercial terms that we introduced earlier in the panel. That'll be seeing our contracts come with pretty use hardware, which turns attached. We are so awesome.

## [16:39:23]
We have to extend your estate deal. You can just go to your new customer in the back contract and provide a more direct route for the basis. If you have a loser customer, we give you about the two months of positive billing so you can redeploy that appliance to a different place. Get that back in production, start earning money for the business. The BCR FastTrack hardware is equally important. Also a premium hardware. We give you 50% off of maintenance for your first day appliances. We also have a great bike belt onboard service to get you to the end.

## [16:39:57]
You have some offers. If you sign a two year subscription to the BCR, you're going to be one year of our SaaS-Baka platform for free. This is outstanding value. It's not a one year deal. It will be six months of the SaaS-Baka platform for free. Excellent. Excellent. Okay. Stay in the prep. A lot of stuff. First, let's go ahead to our presenters. [applause]

## [16:40:31]
I'm going to talk about this stuff for 10 hours. I know you don't want to sit in that chair for too much longer, so we'll spare you this. We've been a lot of talking about the products. I'll tell you, we built this stuff. Talk about the feedback that you get to us. We are very, very excited to hear your feedback on these things. Please keep it coming. It means everything to have this direct engagement with you. So with that, I would like to thank you very, very much for your attendance today. For participation multi so much, it is still great to come here to sit and see who face the face to talk about.
