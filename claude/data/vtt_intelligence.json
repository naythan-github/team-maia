The team agreed to establish Shredex for e-waste with cost-plus pricing, transition to outsourced field services via AWA to improve billing and ticket hygiene, and set clear boundaries with SDMs who pressure engineers to perform out-of-scope work. A customer Intune deployment audit is underway to support Dicker Data vendor negotiations, though major Intune onboarding projects are deferred until the pod structure is established due to their complexity and cost ($50K-$500K per customer)."
