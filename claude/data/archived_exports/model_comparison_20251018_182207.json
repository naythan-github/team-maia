What's Good:\n   - Specific issue description: The comment directly states the problem (\"VPN drops out every 3-5 minutes\").\n\n3. Improvements Needed:\n   - Lack of empathy in the response: The agent could acknowledge the customer's frustration and show understanding for their inconvenience.\n   - No acknowledgement of customer concern: The comment doesn't express any sympathy or acknowledgment that the issue is being taken seriously.\n\n4. Best Practice Techniques:\n   - Acknowledge and empathize with the customer concern: This can be achieved by starting the response with a phrase like \"I understand that...\" to show understanding for the customer's frustration.\n   - Specificity in problem description: The agent could provide additional context or suggestions, such as restarting the VPN connection."
