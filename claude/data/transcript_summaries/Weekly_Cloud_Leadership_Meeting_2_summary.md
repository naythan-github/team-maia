## Decisions Made

### Firm Decisions

1. **Budget Will Go Red During Operating Model Transition** (Hamish)
   - **Context**: Parallel running old/new models, NSG revenue migration out, headcount changes
   - **Rationale**: Gavin support secured, necessary to root cause pricing issues vs bundled subsidies
   - **Impact**: Intentional short-term loss for long-term pricing accuracy

2. **Decompose Budget by Product Lines by EOY** (Hamish)
   - **Products**: Secure Workspace, Cloud, Hybrid
   - **Rationale**: Attribute costs/revenue to products, enable product-specific margins, guide sellers with confidence
   - **Timeline**: Complete decomposition by end of year for FY26 sales kickoff

3. **No New Hires Until Pipeline Materializes** (Hamish)
   - **Context**: Dillon/Peter doing pre-sales (45% billable target), insufficient consultancy/roadmap work won
   - **Status**: 3 new resources considered in budget (Nov+), but on hold
   - **Trigger**: Win more consultancy work to justify adding capacity

4. **Transfer Resource Allocation Ownership to Naythan** (Hamish)
   - **From**: Hamish (too busy with escalations) / Richard (covering gap)
   - **To**: Naythan + Robie (weekly cadence)
   - **Rationale**: Cannot live with Hamish, needs operational owner with headspace

5. **Work Instruction Approach for Change Ticket Enforcement** (Naythan)
   - **Context**: Technical enforcement not possible in OTC
   - **Method**: Policy communication, training, not system control

### Tentative/Conditional Decisions

6. **Consider Contractor Use Until Pipeline Grows** (Hamish, implicit)
   - **Context**: Using Ploy and others to fill gaps without committing to full hire
   - **Condition**: Until PS pipeline supports permanent headcount

---

## Strategic Priorities

### "Transformation Big 3" (Implied from discussion)

1. **Pricing Decomposition & Accuracy**
   - Move from bundled "network subsidizes cloud support" model to transparent product pricing
   - Endpoint team cost + end-user support cost = per-device pricing (example)
   - Scientific margin setting vs bundling reliance

2. **Operating Model Evolution**
   - Separate network services to NSG
   - Establish pod model with clear product ownership
   - Reduce SDMS/PM overhead allocation distortion ("makes things weird")

3. **Resource Allocation & Utilization Discipline**
   - Fix "leaky boat" of unbilled work
   - Weekly allocation cadence for BAU team
   - Consistent timesheet entry for T&M work
   - Evolve to proactively request work from ISDNs when capacity exists

---

## Critical Issues & Risks

### High Impact

1. **Revenue Leakage - Unbilled Billable Work** (Severity: High)
   - **Issue**: Engineers doing billable work without timesheets or job codes
   - **Examples**: Odd jobs since financial year start, codes don't exist or not allocated correctly
   - **Quantification**: ~10 items identified for back-capture (Robie/Jess working list)
   - **Root Cause**: Ad-hoc allocation, inconsistent timesheet discipline, BAU vs project work confusion
   - **Action**: Back-capture via quotes (not timesheets), establish weekly allocation workflow

2. **PS Utilization Below Target** (Severity: High)
   - **Target**: 45% billable (average of Dillon + Peter)
   - **Actual**: Mostly pre-sales, insufficient consultancy/roadmaps
   - **Impact**: Budget assumes capacity-based PS revenue with Nov+ ramp from new hires
   - **Blocker**: Pipeline not materialized yet ("could come fast")

3. **NSG Migration Revenue Impact** (Severity: Medium-High)
   - **Issue**: Network carriage revenue migrating to NSG makes cloud P&L "look not as good"
   - **Hidden Dependency**: Cloud support pricing currently relies on network margin cross-subsidy
   - **Timeline**: Pricing discussion afternoon of meeting, migration imminent
   - **Mitigation**: Repricing cloud offerings to standalone viability

### Medium Impact

4. **Operational Model Parallel Running Costs** (Severity: Medium)
   - **Issue**: Running old + new models simultaneously (e.g., change management dual processes)
   - **Duration**: Transition period through November
   - **Impact**: Overhead duplication, "going to go red"

5. **Process Inconsistency - Change Management** (Severity: Medium)
   - **Issue**: Change artefacts process not consistently followed, dashboard doesn't exist yet
   - **Action**: Training sessions phased by priority users (can't take everyone off changes)
   - **Timeline**: Naythan coordinating with MV for phased rollout

6. **Forecast Volatility** (Severity: Medium)
   - **Issue**: Budget v1 presented, but forecasting process active with "tweaks" ongoing
   - **Variables**: Headcount changes, NSG migration, overhead allocation methodology
   - **Timeline**: Finalized after immediate forecast cycle (next week)

## Notable Quotes

- **Hamish on transformation pain**: "It's going to be 50 Shades of red before it goes green, right? And that's OK."

- **Hamish on root cause focus**: "I think what it means is by doing it, it actually means we get to root cause... once we get the right structures in place then we can put the foot on the gas."

- **Hamish on cross-subsidy problem**: "Our cost to service for end user support... is actually basically reliant on doing network and a few things which is not gonna be reality going forward."

- **Hamish on resource allocation**: "I caught up with Olli I said, are you busy? No, I'm not busy. I'm like, great, let's work on GS1 because we're lagging there."

- **Dillon on revenue leakage**: "We just need to make sure we're getting all these billable work... actually the engineer's hours into these things because otherwise a lot of these things fall under the radar."

- **Naythan (humor)**: "Sorry my. I grinned then because in my head I had your mission, should you choose to accept it."
  **Hamish**: "It's a mission possible, though, so it's not mission impossible."
