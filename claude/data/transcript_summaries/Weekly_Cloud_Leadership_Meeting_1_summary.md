Key focuses: alert noise suppression, Intune customer visibility, architecture alignment with Jono, and completing performance reviews before R.E.M. implementation deadline (Wednesday). Three strategic priorities before Christmas: NSG network handoff, AWA field services management, Services team alignment.

## 🔑 **Decisions Made**

| Decision | Type | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| Split alert work into noise suppression + escalation policy tracks | Firm | Two distinct problems | Parallel progress |
| Monthly architecture sync with Jono | Firm | Prevent vacuum work | Avoid rework |
| Trevor configures unified Lighthouse for Intune | Firm | No centralized view | Unblocks roadmap |
| Hold on LinkedIn "hiring" badge | Tentative | See Russell's quality first | Can broaden later |
| Prioritize device enablement policies | Firm | Biggest service desk value | Supports AWA handoff |
| Top 3 before Christmas: NSG networks, AWA field services, Services alignment | Firm | Strategic capacity unlock | Major ops shift |

## ⚠️ **Critical Issues**

1. **On-Call Escalation Gap**: 4 different escalation docs, some 4 years old. Hamish: "What keeps me up at night is do we have right mechanics for get-out-of-bed alerts?"

2. **Alert Noise Overload**: Azure alerts flooding team (Melbourne office motion detection to cloud team). Thresholds not set.

3. **Intune Visibility**: No definitive customer list (estimate 60-70%). Blocks device enablement.

4. **Architecture Coordination**: Jono in "vacuum" on MSP/re-tenancy work. Risk of misalignment.

5. **Time Pressure**: R.E.M. Wednesday deadline for performance reviews.

## 📊 **Project Status**

**Completed**: ✅ 3CX upgrades, Philippines headcount approved, forecast scrubbed

**In Progress**: 🔄 MessageG 3CX, Jenny tender, hiring (CVs tomorrow), alert analysis

**Blocked**: ⏸️ Device enablement (needs Intune list), HCA project (awaiting date)

## 🎯 **Strategic Priorities (Before Christmas)**

**Big Rocks**:
1. NSG takes over network management
2. AWA manages all field services
3. Align with Services team strategy

**Dependencies**: Device enablement, Intune visibility, base policies, team training
