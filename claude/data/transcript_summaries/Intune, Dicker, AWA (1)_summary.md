<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/9-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So I'm just ready three more times.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/12-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/14-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>All right.
So I think we've since we last played,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/14-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Naythan,
we did get some clarity around a couple</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/14-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>of items or at least some progress on
some of those.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/15-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Think your data doesn't do e-waste.
I've reached out to two AMG.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/15-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>They've got that sister company Shredex.
They've forwarded us a draught agreement</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/15-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>which which has their services on there.
I have.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/15-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I had a quick look at it just before this
meeting, but I haven't.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/16-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I haven't married it up in terms of
pricing, but.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/18-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Just on anyways,
my kind of view is if it's a service</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/18-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>we're selling to a customer,
it's not a core business service.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/18-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>We can just say. So I don't,
I don't really care about the what it</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/18-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>costs.
It's just like we need to work out what</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/17-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>No, it's it's, it's not our call, so yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/18-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>margin we put on it and like here it is.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/19-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah. Would you like to buy it? Yes,
you would. OK, here's the price, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/19-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>plus our margin. And on that stuff,
but almost even.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/21-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>It almost for simplicity,
I'd almost consider whether we do open</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/21-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>book cost plus 10% or something or cost
plus 15% just so that it's like a we</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/21-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>don't have to worry about complex billing
or anything like that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/20-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yep.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/21-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>We're like what's real, it's real easy.
You guys can go directory or anything and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/21-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>go for it. Here it is.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/22-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Set up you're in agreement.
Do whatever you want.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/22-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Otherwise you will agree to pay for
whatever it costs,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/22-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>plus whatever our agreed margin is.
And that's it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/23-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Anyway, that's my view on eways.
Happy to happy to thrash it out with</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/23-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>whoever I'm sure.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/24-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I agree. So you know,
unless anybody's gonna push back.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/24-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And I don't think anybody is.
I think everybody's just looking for an</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/24-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>easy life so.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/25-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Correct.
I don't think anyone cares and and we</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/25-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>probably give it away for free at the
moment anyway.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/25-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So I just think we need to the the next
steps on anyways would be just you know.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/26-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Forming a view,
a written view and proposing it as a as a</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/26-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>terms and conditions,
and then we can agree to use shredex and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/26-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>and move on. I I don't mind them because.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/29-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>They're they're they're they've got the
other services would be to AMG and if we</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/29-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>can do it through an existing vendor,
you know easy and their account</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/27-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Mm-hmm.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/28-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yep, absolutely.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/29-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>management's good.
So they get more both all right,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/29-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>the AWA thing.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/30-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>That for that ticket,
I think we spoke about it, Naythan.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/30-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Our consensus was that with that
particular example, we might have been,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/30-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>it might have ended up. Yes,
there were some issues with them not</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/30-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>looking at the ticket perhaps properly,
but I think.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/31-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>The yeah.
Were you gonna go and speak to Jason</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/31-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>again on that one or?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/32-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I did and yeah. And then I I said well.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/34-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>That's not what we do.
Why are we doing anything?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/34-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Or they said they would pay for it and
blah blah. I'm like, OK, so from now on,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/34-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>anything that is outside our room,
it or our responsibility and we're just</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/34-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>going to try or an SDM is trying to get
you to do something.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/35-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Talk to me and we'll make an informed
decision as whether or not we're doing it</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/35-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>or not.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/36-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So did did the so did the customers say
they paid for it? The guy went out there,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/36-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>tried his stuff.
Now it was a carrier issue and then let</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/36-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>them know the customers saying they're
not gonna pay. Is that how it went down?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/37-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Is so is this the instance where the
customer said they're not gonna pay or it</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/37-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>was somebody else?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/38-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>No. So the one.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/39-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>'Cause, I heard two of them and I'm not.
I couldn't marry up. What was what?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/40-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So the one that I know which is the
Queensland one is the one where the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/40-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>customer said I'm not gonna pay.
I don't know about the details about the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/40-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>NSW 1,
which is where this AWA take one out.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/41-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Right for the NSW 1,
which is what I'm referring to.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/41-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>They just said,
apparently because everything is hearsay</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/41-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>unless somebody shows it to me an e-mail.
I know this isn't your area,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/41-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>but we're in a in a bind.
Can you send someone out and see if you</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/41-4
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>can fix it?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/42-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I haven't dived any deeper,
I just said look if that's not.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/43-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Our thing,
I mean this particular example is going</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/43-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>to be gone once we shift all this across
the networking anyway, but.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/44-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>If it's not us and we're not going to do
it,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/44-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>how can we expect somebody else just to
go out and you know like?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/45-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And the response backwards. Oh well,
the SDMS they put us under pressure to do</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/45-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>all this all the time and sort of stuff.
I'm like, OK, well,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/45-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>we'll deal with that separately.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/46-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>But.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/48-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Let's not make any more trouble for
ourselves, shall we?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/47-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/49-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Can you?
Which SDM was that was for that account?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/50-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I I don't know. I can find out though.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/54-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>If you could might be just,
you're working inside that business,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/51-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Outer.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/54-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>it might make sense for you to.
I just want to know because then we can</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/52-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/54-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>set clear boundaries with that SDM and
then formalise it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/53-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So I am.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/55-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I don't want to throw any stones at the
moment. It sounds like they're all.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/55-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Everyone's panicking.
Everybody's stressed.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/55-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>It sounds like all of the SDMS are doing
things that are not ideal to try to</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/55-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>placate a customer that is already upset.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/56-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So I I don't wanna go be in.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/57-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Or you all.
I really want to do is blameless.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/57-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>This isn't working. We're over here.
We need to be over here.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/57-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And this is how we get there.
So I have a fortnightly meeting with the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/57-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>STMS,
and I have a meeting with Richard A bit</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/57-4
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>later.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/59-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I will mention it without names to
Richard and then I've asked the services</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/58-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Oh good.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/59-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>team to tell me if any continued in the
next two weeks and I'll bring it up with</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/59-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>my fortnightly with them. So.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/60-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah, all good. And I'm not trying to.
I'm not on a witch hunt either.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/60-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>By the way, I I I mean.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/61-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>No, no, I know, but I just,
I'm new and I don't want to risk getting</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/61-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>anybody's hackles up.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/63-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I can do it. I'm. I know. I know.
Our pest. I know. Con.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/63-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So I don't know who else is in SDM.
I'm happy to have a chat with them and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/63-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>just say guys because Con was the guy who
said he gave me the he goes.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/62-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/63-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I overheard you on the phone and,
you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/63-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>we had this example in Queensland.
So he was, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/63-5
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>and I'm pretty good with our pesh so.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/64-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/65-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Cool, now I.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/68-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I wanna help them wrap a process around
it, just so that you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/66-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yes.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/68-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I don't care if we send people out to
site, by the way,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/68-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>all I asked for is do you just get a
written confirmation that the customer</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/68-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>accepts the charges and that's it.
And then we've at least got an ability to</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/68-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>charge, you know,
like you asked for someone to go out</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/67-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yes.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/68-5
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>there, we sent them out there. There's no.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/70-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>It's technology.
There's no guarantee we can fix it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/70-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>You asked for someone to go out.
They went out.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/69-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/71-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah, the.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/74-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>So Martin, as you said you,
so who actually determines that this is a</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/72-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/74-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>chargeable thing is not chargeable.
So is it SDMS who works out that or is it</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/74-2
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Amrit and who who doesn't?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/73-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/75-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Good question. In the perfect world,
our contract system would be integrated</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/75-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>into then this is just me spitballing,
but our contract management system which</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/75-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>we're building is not built yet, would be.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/76-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Would be integrated into into OTC and we
could use a chat bot to interrogate it</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/76-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>saying hey is or it would automatically
suggest like customers ask for field</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/76-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>services.
Is it included or is it not included and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/76-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>then we it would provide clear boundaries
to say yes included or it's included this</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/76-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>much. They've used this much this month.
You know they paid for 10 hours.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/77-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Whatever it is,
and they would be able to make an</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/77-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>informed decision of saying hey,
you know per your contract,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/77-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>this is what it says. You know,
this should be chargeable.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/77-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Do you accept the charges and maybe we'd
like send a little ping out from the the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/77-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>ticket system that says.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/78-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Please hit accept to accept that this is
the charges and we can put the right card.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/79-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/80-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>If this is a regular,
the way I've seen this done before is</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/80-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>that they buy block hours, you know 20,
because otherwise like we don't want to</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/80-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>have to invoice for two hours
individually or whatever and and blah</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/80-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>blah blah. And I'm not particularly.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/81-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>We don't have massive resources to be
able to to do that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/81-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>We'll see how it actually goes.
But if we're getting asked for this</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/81-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>regularly by customers to do stuff,
that is.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/82-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Random and home support.
Do you think we can run that as block</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/82-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>ours or do you think that's contrary to?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/83-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Block hours also has a problem because
it's an end of month process which can</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/83-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>become really painful and then you get
customers they're like Oh well, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/83-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>like I came out and said this and then,
you know, you came out and, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/83-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>there's just this squabbling and you end
up like with this huge end of month</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/83-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>process as well I think.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/84-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah, damned if you do,
damned if you don't, OK?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/85-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/86-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/88-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>You know some stakes in the ground and
sort of holds people accountable. Yeah,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/87-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Point point in time. Yeah. OK, yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/88-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>that's my thought.
Definitely saying that the the block hour</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/88-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>thing can work if you got customers that
are all professional services anyway,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/88-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>and you can just say, look,
you're buying 10 hours at a minimum per</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/88-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>month.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/90-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And use it or lose it.
And if you don't use it or you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/90-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>go over and you gotta be,
you gotta be really strict on on that</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/90-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>kind of stuff.
Otherwise people just take the ****.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/90-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>We we generally tried to move towards all
you can eat all included bundle but.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/91-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>That with CSG,
that was without on site field services</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/91-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>where possible.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/92-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Anyway, I will take, I will take our US.
I will take network request for AWA over</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/92-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>to network team. I'll take that one.
That's that's one we're working on</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/92-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Harpreet,
you don't need to worry about that one.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/92-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>It's already a documented process so.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/94-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>But for for new cloud requests,
that's what Harpreet's working on for the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/94-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>process to to to move that in there and
we have made some progress on that,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/94-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>which I'll just show you.
I spent some time with Harpreet earlier</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/93-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/94-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>today.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/95-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Where is my this year?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/96-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>The video diagram is it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/97-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah, I'll bring it up so good.
I know I see the link so.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/99-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>After you, after having meeting with you,
I was talking to Foram.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/99-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>She's the one that notice that goes on
the on site visits.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/99-2
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>So I was just trying to validate the
scenarios with her,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/99-3
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>but she said she's very new and she does
may not be aware of all sort of scenarios,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/99-4
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>but that's what we're gonna confirm on
Monday with.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/100-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>I'm red, so yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/101-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Who? Who did you speak to?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/102-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Foram Foram.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/103-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>All right.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/104-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Oh,
she I think she's a Level 2 service desk</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/104-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>analyst. Yeah, something like that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/105-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>I met her a few times and that's why I
thought of why not check with her and get</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/105-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>some more information out of it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/106-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah, right. I haven't.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/107-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>She's the one I noticed generally goes on
site.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/108-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Right. OK.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/109-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>But she gave me few other scenarios.
So we'll let's see how I can populate</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/109-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>those things in this diagram.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/110-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>And she said some of the things they do
it remotely,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/110-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>but some of the things the client asked
for, if you can come on side,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/110-2
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>that will be really helpful.
So it's like the thing that depends.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/110-3
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>So that's what I was trying to find out.
Is it a, how do they determine,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/110-4
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>is it a chargeable thing?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/111-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Or what server?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/112-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>They don't is my is my is my feedback to
you, they they wouldn't.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/112-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>We'd have so much revenue leakage from
sending people on site. You know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/112-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>anytime I've asked about it, they're like,
oh, we just charged for the Uber.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/112-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And I guarantee you we don't even charge
for the Uber. We just what happens is.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/113-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Our engineer would expense the Uber
tomorrow and then we would never charge</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/113-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>it to the client,
so it's just complete like zero revenue</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/113-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>coming from doing on site work and just
all cost to us so.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/117-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>But she said it's generally STMS and I
think Amrit, I don't know.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/114-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/117-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>They work out among themselves or maybe
they have some other someone else and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/115-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/116-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/120-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So Sangeetha Geeth is probably a good
contact to speak to about that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/117-2
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>longly.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/120-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>She used to help coordinate some of that
stuff Gina made. I I I can. I said that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/118-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Move.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/119-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>We.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/120-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Gina,
I'm worried that we don't have a TNM</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/120-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>component in.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/121-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>In OTC,
she said she made a tick box in OTC where</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/121-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>they can make it a chargeable ticket,
but IA 100% guarantee you that we you</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/121-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>know,
there's just a massive disconnect and I'm</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/121-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>not blaming the the service desk for this.
If we don't,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/121-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>if we don't make it easy for them.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/122-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And if no, and if they don't,
so and and if they even know it's there,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/122-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>and if it's even still there.
Because yesterday I was told a few</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/122-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>stories about changes were rolled out.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/125-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And they were there for a couple of weeks
and then they disappeared again. Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/124-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Really.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/125-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Which is what happens when you're working
with a monolith and not enough developers.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/126-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/127-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/128-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Then they just stop using it,
and if there's not, push back.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/128-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>But if there's something that needs to be
used then.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/130-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>We need to make a part of a training
package.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/129-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/132-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yes, I agree. I don't think.
I think we're not even there yet.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/132-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I think we need first we need to just get
the basics in and I think I would,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/132-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I would rather see a revenue dip from us
just moving to an AWI model first of all.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/132-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And then we quickly fix up our processing
system, our process,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/131-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Mm-hmm.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/132-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>the bill and our system.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/133-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>To Bill and the training piece to the
guys as well,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/133-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I'd rather fix that as a separate item
because if we don't get the AWA thing</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/133-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>stood up, we're just gonna be, you know,
doing the stuff like in Brisbane and and.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/134-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And sending people out there and buying
tools and wasting time and, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/134-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>spending money on Ubers,
at least the what the AWA thing will give</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/134-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>us. Naythan, is ticket data.
So we'll be able to mine that ticket data</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/134-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>for seeing cut, you know,
we'll be able to get a report from Awa</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/134-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>going, you know.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/135-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Engineer went out to this site for this
many hours, troubleshooted this stuff,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/135-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>and automatically we're gonna get some
ticket hygiene just from the the feedback</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/135-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>we'll get from from AWA rather than using
our own guys.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/136-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/137-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So I just I can't remember whether you
were in Hamish's meeting or not, Naythan,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/137-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>but I just,
I just need some help to try and get wrap</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/137-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>around you know where Dicker and Awa fit
into all this so I can share this</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/137-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>document with you as well,
but we just quickly put together some use</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/137-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>cases on what I thought.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/138-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Use cases just to get ahead of this
meeting and get ahead of catching up with</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/138-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Amrit.
So we just documented a bunch of use</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/138-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>cases or just brain dump those and then
we put, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/138-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>just to give a review like you know
customer order is a laptop once you know</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/138-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>config and set up that would that would
touch sticker data and.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/139-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>UA Dicker would do the Intune you know
pre registration piece AWA would you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/139-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>go to the site, open the laptop,
plug it in,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/139-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>log in whatever existing customer asked
for a laptop,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/139-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>wipe that's them sending it to dicker
data and it's gonna be service desk</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/139-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>invalid pro that are probably.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/140-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>A part of that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/141-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/142-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So yeah, we did all this.
I'll share it with you.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/142-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And then in terms of what we wanted to
get done for next week was.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/143-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And Harpreet's gonna test this with
Hamish, but it was like, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/143-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>what is the process for a field services
request? And she's done.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/143-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>She's done a more this was me just,
you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/143-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>just putting some stuff in there that we
need to do,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/143-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>you know field service request.
You know what is the use case ad hoc</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/143-5
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>customer request site down monthly site
visit whatever.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/145-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Does the customer have on site support
included or not?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/145-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>We've talked about that one just then.
Let's assume they do. You know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/145-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>if they're not, if not approved.
If included, we log the job straight away.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/145-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Who loves the job?
We just need to determine who the owner</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/145-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>is to log the job. Is IT service desk?
Isn't provisioning.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/145-5
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I would suggest it's service desk.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/144-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Hmm.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/146-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>List an interim manually jog the log.
The job in the web portal.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/146-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>This is what the web portal looks like.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/147-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>We'll do that manually for now,
and these are prerequisites and what they</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/147-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>need,
and then once it's completed to get</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/147-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>closed,
is it chargeable or not billing to decide</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/147-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>if customer is billed or not closed.
So I just said.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/149-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So what do you mean by billing?
To decide if customer is billed or not?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/148-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/150-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So they might they, we might,
we might have,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/150-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>if we've got a AWA ticket and an OTC
ticket,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/150-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>they might be able to do the contract.
Look up here to say, you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/150-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>is it a chargeable or not chargeable
ticket.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/152-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Doesn't need to go and on the top before
we provide the support to them,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/152-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>so we need to work out that before and
then we can progress on this logging a</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/151-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/152-2
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>ticket and all those things.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/153-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>It depends. It depends.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/154-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Oh yeah, it depends on the your skins.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/155-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>So it depends if we've got. Yeah. Yeah.
Ideally yes.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/155-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>If we take network out network should
definitely they should have it a pretty</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/155-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>mailed process for that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/156-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>But yes, I think you know,
ideally at this at this at this level</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/156-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>you'd want to know that we're not there,
but again call it a secondary,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/156-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I would say I would even mark the ones in
red where like you know,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/156-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>once we get contract management system
set up, this was where.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/157-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>You know,
that decision will be made and we should.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/157-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>It's a too.
It's a too difficult situation where for</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/157-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>a service desk person to make that call,
we need to make the call for them and and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/157-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>they just need to be able to log a ticket
or not.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/159-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Yeah, definitely. Yeah.
I think that maybe Amrit will be able to</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/158-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yep.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/159-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>plus how they do that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/161-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah,
but just remember what they're doing</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/161-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>currently is probably, you know,
it's probably a complete throwaway and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/160-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>It's not going to be there in the future
sleep.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/161-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>assume that assume nothing and assume
that we've got to, we've got to go in and.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/162-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And give them the process to work with.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/163-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/164-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Cool, alright,
I'll share that with you in case you want</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/164-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>to look at it or throw it away. Naythan.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/165-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/167-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Do we make any progress on the getting
that document together on which customers</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/167-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>have engine and which don't?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/169-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>No, sorry. I think after I spoke to her,
I spoke to Mariel where she was going off</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/168-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Go ahead.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/169-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>and doing some other stuff that I still
have to get her a refined look up list so</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/169-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>that she can further philtre.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/170-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>But.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/172-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Is it is it? Is it something to like?
How hard is it to check it?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/171-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I've actually done it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/172-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Is it something we could get hot pre to
log into to?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/173-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>The most so we already have a spreadsheet
that has everything that the customers</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/173-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>are buying from us.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/174-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>OK.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/175-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And those line items,
but at the next level after that is.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/178-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>If we wanted more detail then we'd be
logging in through lighthouse and looking</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/178-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>at things and everything else,
and that process hasn't even started.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/177-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Gotcha.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/178-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>But we do have spreadsheet with
everything that customers are buying.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/178-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>It just wasn't granular enough.
So I've created the extra granular stuff</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/178-4
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I needed to get to Mariel so that she can
update the.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/179-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Spreadsheet,
and then we'll have radio buttons for</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/179-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>book, book, book, book.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/180-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Cool.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/181-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>This this is you want it now. So you know,
for the dicker side of things, or yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/182-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah, 'cause,
I mean and then we need to understand you</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/182-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>know,
the other part that we need to finalise,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/182-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>the dicker thing is,
we need to some sort of volumes,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/182-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>whether we're gonna make them up or we're
going to if we if you're able to mine the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/182-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>data in some meaningful way.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/183-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Because their pricing will be based on
volumes, if we can't provide volume,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/183-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>then they're going to give us probably
RRP, whatever it is,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/183-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>whatever we can grovel off them.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/184-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/185-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>OK so.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/188-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Honestly, I I don't even for me,
I'd I'd start with their list price</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/188-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>anyway, just to outsource the whole thing.
You know what I mean?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/188-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And then we can go back and.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/186-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/187-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I think.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/191-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>From what I've been hearing,
we actually don't have that many that are</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/189-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/191-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>active within tune at the moment,
but that's anecdotal.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/191-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>It's something that we want.
It's something that we want to be able to</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/190-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Wouldn't surprise me.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/191-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>start pushing to them.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/193-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah, well,
my if that was the if that was the case,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/192-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>To our customers.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/193-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>whatever it is,
let's say it's one out of 20.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/193-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>What is the cost for us to like if we
absorb the cost,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/193-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>what does that cost to to push those
customers to that you know that's what</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/193-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I'd be interested in understanding if
that is, you know X per month then.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/194-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>You know,
do we want the the workflow goes,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/194-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>do we want to accept that cost,
yes or do we try and get customers to</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/195-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Oh, no, no, no, we wouldn't. I don't know,
we would not.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/194-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>upgrade?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/195-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>It's if they don't have anything at all
in that space. It's not light touch.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/195-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So that's not project level costs that we
would absorb just to not have to worry</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/195-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>about it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/196-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Do we have to then go and reimage every
machine as the enabler?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/197-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And tonnes of stuff like and set up and
configuring policies and and whatnot.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/197-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>You know, like this is for most.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/198-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Oh, my God. OK, OK then.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/199-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So they may have something already and
we're not already managing it or it may</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/199-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>not be like we have to work,
we have to work that out. But and I,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/199-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I haven't even started asking questions
about that yet,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/199-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>but that's depending on the size of the
customer.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/199-4
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>That's anything from a 50 to $500,
000 project.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/201-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And they may already be doing something
already,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/200-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Then to me.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/201-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>and it's a bit clunky and all we have to
do is tweak it,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/201-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>but this is not really going to happen
until if we're not actively managing the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/201-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>environment now,
then it's not going to happen until we've</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/201-4
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>got the pod stored up.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/202-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Is.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/203-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>My you know my prediction?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/204-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>That's OK. We can plan ahead in, in that,
in. In that case,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/204-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I'll provide the opinion you didn't ask
for Naythan and that is.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/205-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I know Hamish is thinking new world,
but I I don't think if that's the case</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/205-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>then we don't have a I don't think we
have a choice.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/205-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>We have to look at what an ISO world
looks like. An outsourcing.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/207-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And and when I heard you say that before
I thought, yes, probably as well.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/205-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>That's a dicker.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/206-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/207-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>But I don't know what we've got now yet
so.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/208-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>All good, all good.
Just I know that Hamish has always said I</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/208-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>don't want to.
He doesn't care about the old World.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/208-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I don't care either. But at the same time,
I don't see us getting to the new world</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/208-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>until we figure out how to make the old
world a bit crap. Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/209-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Yeah, that's the problem even I'm facing.
Yeah,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/209-1
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>we didn't need to have the as is process
to go in the 2B process. Yeah,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/209-2
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>the current world.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/212-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah,
we need to understand what what we're</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/210-0
<v Harpreet Kaur | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/212-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>doing currently.
And then I think we sadly have to fix</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/212-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>some of the current world. I don't really.
I think that process is is rubbish.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/211-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/212-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>But again I don't, I don't care.
I just want to fix it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/213-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Not not doing the heap of work,
whatever the minimum viable product is</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/213-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>that makes us more efficient and makes
things flow a bit smoother and makes us</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/213-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>actually build customers for what they
consume. That's a win,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/213-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>and I'd still rather outsource it to dig
a data. So OK.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/214-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>In terms of that list,
do you have any feel on when we when we</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/214-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>would get some view on that,
Naythan the in tune versus non in tune?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/215-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Umm.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/216-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>And the next week.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/217-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I can.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/218-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/219-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I can work towards that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/220-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I'll get the subcategory stuff to Mario.
That high level,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/220-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>what we're selling should be done fairly
quickly. We'll be able to go, yes, no.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/221-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And then I'll have to try to get one of
the guys to have a look through different</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/221-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>portals to see who's got what activated.
But when we had.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/222-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Quick look the other day it looked like
some customers had only turned on like 1</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/222-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>licence in the portal,
which meant they had some of the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/222-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>functionality.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/224-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Which probably means that they were.
I don't know if you know the way this</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/223-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>God.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/224-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>works,
but as soon as you turn on a feature in</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/224-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>your tenant,
it's enabled everywhere for a lot of it,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/224-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>it's enabled anywhere because it's high
level.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/225-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Gate functions, let's say.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/226-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>You don't have to assign licences and
everything else you get the functions</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/226-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>doesn't matter if you're 50 or 5000.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/229-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So you know a customer could be 100 users
or 1000 users.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/229-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Turn it on to test and then start rolling
out and not realise that they hadn't</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/229-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>bought all the other licences.
So the point of the story is,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/227-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/228-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/229-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>until you actually get to look into the
configuration.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/230-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>You don't know,
but we had a lot of what I do remember</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/230-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>from that is a lot of customers had high
level licences that included all of that</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/230-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>functionality and those ones typically
may have started deploying it and using</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/230-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>it.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/231-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So I've just asked Peter and Dylan.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/232-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>If we've got a look but.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/233-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>If we've got a field but no.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/234-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Trevors getting access to everything I
believe this week I can get one of the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/234-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>projects guys to go through what
lighthouse access.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/235-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Trevor might be a good Trevor might be a
good resource to use PowerShell to speed</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/235-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>up that process for just interrogating it
that way. And if it's possible.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/236-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Maybe I'll ask him, but if it's.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/238-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I don't know how easy that'll be due from
a central position into lighthouse.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/238-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>If he's got it sorted, no problem,
but it may also be quick to just go into</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/238-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>lighthouse and go 102 hundred 300.
But yeah, I'll ask.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/237-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/238-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>He may not have the access yet.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/241-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I'm coming in from a position of no idea,
so that that's.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/239-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Mm-hmm.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/241-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I'm just trying to suggest thing cool,

45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/240-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/242-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Leave it with me.

45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/243-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>No worries.</v>

<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Do we have a can I?

<v Martin Dunn | Orro>they're procuring only need viewing
access only.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/244-3
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Is that the list Jenny put together or
something before she left?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/246-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I think Mario put it together recently.
It's full export and everything else.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/246-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah, I'm sure, Ken,

45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/245-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>North Yep.</v>

45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/248-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Down to whatever,
and we'll put it somewhere central,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/248-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>even if we have to set up a new team for
us to work on.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/247-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah, cool.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/249-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>What I what I might do?
What I want to do is I feel like we need</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/249-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>a like a task manager for all these tasks.
Just so that.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/251-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yeah,
we're we're taking these off if if you,</v>

<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>And.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/253-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I'm built.
I'm building 1 now because it's just too</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/251-2
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>created one.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/252-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>OK.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/253-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>much.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/255-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Yes, yeah, yeah.
So are you using my task manager in teams</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/254-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Help.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/255-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>or something or what are you using?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/256-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I was going to use Trello.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/257-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Oh.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/258-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Just 'cause it's so much easier and.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/260-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Have you used the teams one before?
It's actually not too bad,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/260-1
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I know it hasn't got all the nice colours
planner. Yeah.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/259-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>You mean planner?</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/262-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>Yeah, the the problem.
The thing I don't like. Yeah,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/261-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I think it's plan on.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/262-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>you can bet it in teams and everything
else.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/262-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>The thing I don't like about it is that
you, unless it's changed recently,</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/262-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>you can't at mention someone.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/263-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So inside the the ticket so they don't
see it said that like Trello just craps</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/263-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>all over planner functions like so much
easy.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/264-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>I'm pretty sure you can assign the task
to someone.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/265-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>You can assign it to someone,
but then you're handing over the</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/265-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>ownership. It's like ticket clicking.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/266-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>So even if it's my task and I'm
responsible and I want to get an update</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/266-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>from you in Trello, I can go at Martin.
Did you get an answer from this and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/266-2
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>you'll get an e-mail with that linking to
it and you can jump straight to it and</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/266-3
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>see it and it stays in that primary
history.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/270-0
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>I don't believe there's any way in
planner still that I can do that and we</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/267-0
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>Gotcha.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/270-1
<v Naythan Dawe | Orro>can all work on it and everything else.

other problem and.</v>
45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/290-0

45ad34c2-b76a-4917-b462-22ab8e673465/290-4
<v Martin Dunn | Orro>pieces. I don't want to add in, you know,
