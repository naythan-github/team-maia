## Action Items

### Critical Priority (P0)

1. **Naythan + Hamish + Nigel**: Align on hiring strategy and timelines THIS WEEK
   - **Deadline**: This week (Tuesday-Wednesday)
   - **Owner**: Naythan (lead), Hamish (strategy), Nigel (execution)
   - **Context**: Day 5 of Naythan's tenure, JDs not yet approved, confusion on priorities
   - **Dependencies**: Hiring timelines drive parallel structure costs → Marielle budget impact
   - **Status**: Blocking - must happen before recruiter (Russell) engagement

2. **Naythan + Dillon + Gina (OTC)**: Design new change management process
   - **Deadline**: This week
   - **Owner**: Naythan (process owner)
   - **Context**: Current ITIL maturity 2/10, just caused Ampac 10-day P1 from own goal
   - **Steps**: (a) Dillon show legacy artifacts, (b) Gina show OTC change module, (c) Workshop new process
   - **Rationale**: "Stem the bleeding" - Naythan's priority intervention to slow self-inflicted incidents
   - **Impact**: Reduce MV overwork, prevent repeat Ampac-style outages

3. **Naythan**: Intervene on Mandeep (MV) overwork and bottleneck situation
   - **Deadline**: Immediate (potentially Melbourne trip, not yet booked)
   - **Owner**: Naythan
   - **Context**: MV involved in "way too much", everything requires his approval, health deteriorating (constantly sick, P1s at night)
   - **Root Causes**: (a) Overworked/rushing → mistakes (Ampac vnet isolation miss), (b) Only 2 people (MV + Llewellyn) with capability, (c) No team empowerment, (d) MV doesn't want Hamish "looking over horizon"
   - **Actions**: Offload tasks, establish delegation model, empower team to own end-to-end without approval gates
   - **Blocker**: MV wants to move to consulting but won't let go of BAU, creating catch-22

4. **Hamish + Naythan + JP + Marielle**: Pipeline hygiene grooming session
   - **Deadline**: This week
   - **Owner**: Hamish (lead)
   - **Context**: Pipeline "terrible data quality", real work not in system (e.g., Wink uplift quoted but not in pipeline)
   - **Actions**: Close old inactive items, add known active work, establish "just real and accurate" baseline
   - **Impact**: Marielle needs pipeline for revenue forecasting + headcount justification

### High Priority (P1)

5. **Hamish**: Get Alex to provide SGS training/enablement
   - **Deadline**: This week
   - **Owner**: Hamish
   - **Recipients**: Principles (Dillon, Peter), Naythan, Trevor
   - **Context**: First "devices" project kicked off, need foundational training

6. **Hamish + Naythan + Marielle**: Forecast parallel operating structure costs
   - **Deadline**: Next week or two
   - **Owner**: Hamish (lead), Naythan (timelines), Marielle (budget impact)
   - **Context**: Hiring new roles while old structure still runs → "going red pretty quickly"
   - **Question**: "How long do we keep two parallel obstructions running?"
   - **Status**: Gavin aware and managing board message

7. **Hamish**: Add Philippines patching team member role to pipeline
   - **Deadline**: This week
   - **Owner**: Hamish
   - **Context**: Wink uplift grinding, team member on leave, capacity doesn't match ambitions
   - **Rationale**: Procedural work until automation possible, justifies with Wink revenue

8. **Hamish + Naythan**: Design Jessica's pre-sales stand-up coordination role
   - **Deadline**: This week
   - **Owner**: Hamish
   - **Context**: Jessica = new pre-sales admin with capacity across cloud+collab
   - **Goal**: Drive daily stand-up, enforce quoting hygiene, prevent retrospective invoicing chaos
   - **Development**: Empowerment + skill building for Jessica

9. **Marielle**: Present full budget walkthrough to leadership team next week
   - **Deadline**: Next week's leadership meeting
   - **Owner**: Marielle
   - **Context**: Budget not formally endorsed (Q1 approved, rest pending AI/strategic revisions from board)
   - **Goal**: Level set team on goalposts before making changes

10. **Marielle**: Coordinate with Sarah on personnel cost changes from "what group"
    - **Deadline**: Before next budget presentation
    - **Owner**: Marielle
    - **Context**: Some costs moving to another BU, affects personnel line

### Medium Priority (P2)

11. **Hamish + Dillon + Peter + Naythan**: Establish new project hire for Secure Workspace Principal
    - **Deadline**: Starting Monday (engineeringmanager)
    - **Owner**: Hamish (coordination)
    - **Context**: Third principal to complement Dillon (Hybrid) and Peter (Cloud)
    - **Impact**: Complete product-aligned leadership trio

12. **Hamish + Team + Gavin + Leadership**: Resolve helpdesk strategy and BU structure
    - **Deadline**: Next week (discussion scheduled)
    - **Owner**: Hamish (initiator/champion)
    - **Context**: "Kicked over another hornets nest"
    - **Problem**: Tenders require helpdesk (Coco Republic, etc.), but cloud team treats it as cost, no pre-sales capability
    - **Proposed**: Make helpdesk a separate tower/BU (Network, Collab, Cloud, Fibre, Helpdesk Services)
    - **Benefit**: Proper quoting (call volume, busy day, knowledge base articles), pre-sales expertise, cost optimization discussions
    - **Current**: "Northwest kind of did it" but not mature, cloud/Dillon don't have expertise
    - **Strategic**: If prosecuting tender market aggressively, need capability

13. **Team + Marielle**: Backlog invoicing reconciliation (Robbie + Jess working through)
    - **Deadline**: Ongoing (first month closed, retrospective items flowing)
    - **Owner**: Robbie (Philippines project coordinator) + Jess (quotes)
    - **Context**: $10K projects from BAU team not tracked for percentage complete
    - **Solution**: Robbie maintains OTC percentage complete data → Marielle earned value accounting

## Decisions Made

### Firm Decisions

1. **Establish Weekly Leadership Meeting Cadence** (Hamish)
   - **Format**: Projects/ops issues, HR (Kristy join), Finance (Marielle join)
   - **Goal**: No more multiple emails, coordinate hiring/costs/project impacts in one room
   - **Participants**: Hamish, Naythan, Dillon, Peter, + 3rd Principal when hired, Marielle, (Kristy)
   - **Purpose**: Level set, resilient teams vs point people, visibility

2. **PNL Decomposition by Products** (Hamish → Marielle/Sarah handover)
   - **Products**: Secure Workspace, Cloud, Hybrid
   - **Rationale**: "Talk same language", traceability from balance sheet → service catalogue
   - **Timeline**: In progress, Safina working on it, Hamish handing to Marielle/Sarah
   - **Impact**: Product-aligned financials matching product-aligned principals

3. **Change Management Priority #1 Operational Intervention** (Naythan + Hamish agreement)
   - **Rationale**: Ampac 10-day P1 from self-inflicted vnet mistake, ITIL maturity 2/10, creating overwork → mistakes cycle
   - **Approach**: Understand OTC capabilities, workshop new process, enforce/educate
   - **Quote**: "What if we just stop changing things as quickly and as rapidly?" - Naythan (Day 1 observation)
   - **Expected**: Will reduce MV overload, prevent shooting selves in foot

4. **Move Mandeep (MV) from BAU to Consulting** (Hamish, with team support)
   - **Context**: MV wants to be consultant but won't let go of BAU → overworked + bottleneck
   - **Forcing Function**: "Forcing function for others to step up" - if MV gone, team must empower
   - **Approach**: Naythan to help transition, empower team for end-to-end ownership without approval gates
   - **Timeline**: Immediate intervention needed (health + quality impacts visible)

5. **Budget Will Go Red with Parallel Structure** (Hamish, Gavin aware)
   - **Context**: Hiring new roles (principals, engineers, etc.) while old structure still operational
   - **Board**: Q1 approved, full year pending AI/strategic narrative revisions
   - **Status**: Budget "not formally endorsed", "numbers still fluid", "feels like US Congress supply situation"
   - **Communication**: Gavin managing board expectations, team to be level set next week

6. **Earned Value Revenue Recognition for Projects** (Marielle + Hamish clarification)
   - **Method**: Percentage of completion based on project manager OTC inputs
   - **Example**: $100K project 50% complete → recognize $50K revenue
   - **Context**: Peter asking about when revenue counted (answer: not at final payment, but progressive)

### Tentative/Under Discussion

7. **Helpdesk as Separate Tower/BU** (Hamish proposal, leadership discussion next week)
   - **Status**: "Everyone agreed we need to think about this"
   - **Problem**: Can't tender competitively without helpdesk pre-sales capability
   - **Option**: Create helpdesk services BU with dedicated pre-sales, pricing models, volume metrics
   - **Benefit**: Stop treating as cost, start selling competitively
   - **Challenge**: Cloud team doesn't have expertise (Dillon/Hamish acknowledged)
   - **Timeline**: Discussion next week with Gavin + leadership

---

## Strategic Priorities

### "Transformation & Maturity" Themes

1. **Operational Maturity** (ITIL 2/10 → Target unclear but >2)
   - **Current**: Self-inflicted outages (Ampac vnet), no change visibility (only chat notifications), MV manual change management
   - **Target**: OTC-enabled change process, visibility for leadership, empowered team execution
   - **Timeline**: Immediate (this week Naythan-led intervention)

2. **Financial Visibility & Control**
   - **Current**: Retrospective invoicing, no percentage complete tracking, pipeline inaccurate
   - **Target**: Real-time earned value, accurate pipeline, product-decomposed P&L
   - **Enablers**: Marielle integration, Robbie coordinator hygiene, Jessica pre-sales stand-up ownership
   - **Timeline**: Weeks-months (hygiene improvements), months (P&L decomposition)

3. **Team Empowerment & Scalability**
   - **Current**: MV bottleneck (everything requires approval), only 2 capable people (MV + Llewellyn)
   - **Target**: Empowered end-to-end ownership, distributed capability
   - **Blockers**: MV won't let go, capability gap in team
   - **Approach**: Force MV transition, skill up team, hire for capability
   - **Quote**: "No one empowered to own task and deliver start to finish without approval" - Peter

4. **Product-Aligned Organization**
   - **Structure**: 3 Principals (Dillon/Hybrid, Peter/Cloud, TBD/Secure Workspace) + product P&L
   - **Finance**: Decompose budget/actuals by product line
   - **Rationale**: Traceability, accountability, strategic clarity
   - **Status**: In progress (Safina → Marielle handover)

5. **Pre-Sales & Tender Capability**
   - **Current**: No helpdesk pre-sales capability, blind bidding on tenders
   - **Gap**: Don't ask volume metrics, call patterns, knowledge base maturity
   - **Proposal**: Separate helpdesk tower with dedicated pre-sales
   - **Impact**: Competitive tendering for Coco Republic, others requiring "everything in tower"

### "Budget & Hiring" Strategic Context

- **August Performance**: $243K EBITDA vs $76K budget (167K ahead, 320% of plan)
  - MRR aligned ($2 variance)
  - PS ahead (more work completed + Millennium revenue recovery - Wap Hour over-recognition)
  - Hardware spike (Marked licensing $240K annual recognition)
  - PS Vendor unbudgeted (Ploy contractors: Stephen/Wink AD, James/Clarity)

- **Hiring Impact**: Multiple open roles not in budget → "red pretty quickly"
  - Secure Workspace Principal (starting Monday)
  - Engineers for pods
  - Philippines patching resource
  - Parallel structure overlap period

- **Board Dynamics**: Initial budget "not aggressive or strategic enough" → revise with AI narrative → Q1 approved, rest pending

## Critical Issues & Risks

### Severity: Critical

1. **Ampac 10-Day Outage from Self-Inflicted Change** (Root Cause: Process + Overwork)
   - **Technical**: Mandeep created vnet ahead of approval, moved across, turned on → broke everything
   - **Process**: No proper isolation, jumped gate before work approved, no change control
   - **Impact**: 10-day recovery ongoing, team diverted (contributing to MV overload cycle)
   - **Capability**: Only MV or Llewellyn can fix these situations, but MV caused it
   - **Assessment**: "Kicked own goals", "shooting selves in foot"
   - **PIR Status**: Not yet conducted

2. **Mandeep (MV) Overwork & Health Crisis** (People + Operational Risk)
   - **Symptoms**: Constantly sick, health deteriorating, P1s at night, rushed work causing mistakes
   - **Workload**: "Involved in way too much", "every 12 things go to him for approval"
   - **Capability Bottleneck**: Only MV + Llewellyn have Azure expertise, rest of team can't act independently
   - **Catch-22**: Wants consulting role but won't release BAU → overworked in BAU → no time for consulting
   - **Risk**: Single point of failure, quality degradation, health collapse
   - **Hamish Quote**: "One of the people on distress... health's not been great, constantly sick... overworked and staying up all night doing P1s last thing you want when trying to beat flu"

3. **ITIL Maturity 2/10** (Process Maturity Risk)
   - **Change Management**: MV manually managing all changes, no OTC visibility, no dashboard exists
   - **Visibility**: Leadership only sees Teams chat notifications post-facto
   - **Empowerment**: Team not authorized for end-to-end ownership without MV approval
   - **Impact**: Creates overwork → mistakes → incidents → more overwork (vicious cycle)
   - **Naythan Assessment**: Day 1 observation "what if we stop changing things as quickly and as rapidly?"

### Severity: High

4. **Pipeline Data Quality "Terrible"** (Financial Forecasting Risk)
   - **Example**: Wink uplift - work done, quoted, likely accepted → not in pipeline
   - **Root Cause**: No systematic pipeline entry process
   - **Impact**: Marielle can't forecast, can't justify headcount, can't track to budget
   - **Hamish Quote**: "Pipeline terrible in terms of data quality... What's real and what's not is different"
   - **Remediation**: Grooming session this week with Hamish/Naythan/JP/Marielle

5. **Budget Not Formally Endorsed** (Strategic Uncertainty)
   - **Status**: "Hasn't been fully endorsed", Q1 "sort of approved", rest pending
   - **Context**: Initial submission "not aggressive or strategic enough" → back to board with AI/transformation story
   - **Impact**: Numbers "still fluid", can't definitively commit to hiring plans
   - **Mitigation**: Gavin managing board message, team to be level set next week

6. **Helpdesk Pre-Sales Capability Gap** (Tender Competitiveness Risk)
   - **Tenders**: Coco Republic, others require "everything in tower" including helpdesk
   - **Current**: "No one asking" volume metrics, call patterns, busy day, knowledge base maturity
   - **Expertise**: "Not in Hamish's expertise, not in Dillon's expertise"
   - **Impact**: Blind bidding or declining tenders
   - **Strategic Misalignment**: Treating helpdesk as cost when tenders require it as service
   - **Quote**: "Stop selling stuff for a bit" vs "what about all these tenders coming up"

### Severity: Medium

7. **Day 5 Confusion on Naythan's Priorities** (Transition Risk)
   - **Context**: JDs presented to Naythan on Day 5, not yet approved
   - **Issues**: Nigel "confused", "conflated shipping", not aligned on who's doing what
   - **Blocker**: Can't engage Russell (recruiter) without Naythan/Hamish/Nigel alignment
   - **Timeline Dependency**: Hiring timelines → parallel costs → Marielle budget impact
   - **Resolution**: Must happen this week (Tuesday-Wednesday call scheduled)

8. **Retrospective Financial Hygiene Backlog** (Accounting Accuracy)
   - **Issue**: First month closed, but retrospective invoicing flowing, percentage complete not tracked
   - **Impact**: Revenue recognition delays, cash flow timing
   - **Solution In Progress**: Robbie (Philippines) + Jess tracking odd jobs, percentage complete updates
   - **Marielle Quote**: "Good serving revenue" from PS vendors (Ploy: Stephen/Wink, James/Clarity) not originally budgeted
