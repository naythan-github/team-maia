I can see that you spoke with one of my colleagues and that you would like Automatic Online Archiving enabled. I am seeking direction from KD Bus in regard to this as there are costs associated. I am also seeking information on the KD Bus Record Keeping policy as it is possible that business related emails should be stored in a suitable system and not retained in email mailboxes. This often causes issues with access to relevant information once someone leaves the organisation. Or if emails are accidentally deleted.<br>I&#39;ll provide an update when information comes to hand.<br>In the meantime, the manual moving of emails and deletion of non-relevant emails should be a viable workaround.</p><p>Thank you</p>",2025-07-16 16:26:43,positive
